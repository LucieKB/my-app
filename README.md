# The Grouping Tool 

The Grouping Tool is an single page application meant to help teachers when they work with their students in a group setting

## Running the App

You will need to first have to open two terminals and have :
1. the local server running by typing 
```npm run server```
2. Start the app on your browser by typing
```npm start```

## Using the Grouping Tool

The "Home" tab gives you some background on the research that lead to the development of this app, and how to use it.
Every student then takes a short personality Test in the "Add a New Student" tab. Based on those results, the student will be assigned an animal personality. [Dr Gary Smalley and Dr John Trent's studies] (https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/47076_Hess___Ch1.pdf) have shown that in a work setting, the team's efficiency and productivity was optimal if the team was made of members of different personalities. 

Once all the students have completed the test, the tab "Student List" will list the students according to their personality type. The teacher can check the student's answer and what that personality type's strengths and weaknesses are, before typing a group number in the text area.

Once the activity is over, the teacher can choose to delete a student individually from the database, or all students at once if they are working with a new class.
